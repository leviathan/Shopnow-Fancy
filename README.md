ShopNow Fancy
====================

This is the "ShopNow Fancy" iOS Test solution for the ShopNow GmbH. All Objective-C files use the 'SNF' prefix for ShopNow.

### Project Setup

Clone the project including submodules:

	$ git clone --recursive xxx
	$ cd Shopnow Fancy
	$ gem install cocoapods
  $ pod setup
  $ pod install

Build and run the 'Shopnow Fancy.xcworkspace' project using XCode (or any IDE of your choice).

#### Cocoapods

#### Ruby Version Manager (RVM)

Using a custom RVM set in order to keep the required ruby gems (I'm looking at you cocoapods) separated from anything else, which is installed on the developer machine.

You will need ruby 1.9.3-p327 installed.

### External Dependencies

External dependencies are managed via cocoapods. Check the Podfile to see, which external components and libraries are beeing used in the project.
